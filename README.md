# DisneylandTicketNotification
Due to COVID-19, Tokyo Disneyland conducts limits on attendance, making it hard to get tickets. But I want to visit Disneyland anyway. So I wrote a script to snap up tickets and send notifications through Telegram bot when tickets are available.

## Preliminaries
* Selenium
* [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
* [The Botfather](https://telegram.me/botfather). It is a Telegram bot and I used it to send me notifications when tickets are available.
